# character_set


A character set is a set of symbols and encodings. Suppose that we have an alphabet with four letters : A, B, a, b.

We give each letter a number : A = 0, B = 1, a = 2, b = 3.

The letter A is a symbol, the number 0 is the encoding for A and the combination of all four letters and their encodings is a character set.
